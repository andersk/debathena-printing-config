debathena-printing-config (1.23.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Test system and argstyle, when adding zephyr args so as not to break
    LPRng queues (Trac: #710)
  * Modify tests to account for the fact that we're now calling
    common.find_queue twice

debathena-printing-config (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Work around broken cups-lpq interactions between 1.4 servers and
    older clients, by falling back to LPD manually implemented if the
    arguments to lpq are trivial (Trac: #652).

debathena-printing-config (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Reed ]
  * Fix package name in maintainer scripts

  [ Evan Broder ]
  * Add a debathena.printing Python module for common logic:
    - Determining the print system and print server to use based on the
      name of a queue
    - Parsing and filtering arguments in common ways.
    - Actually dispatching commands between CUPS and LPRng.
  * Add a test suite for debathena.printing and run it during package
    builds.
  * Kill the totally unused debathena-cluster-printing-config package.
  * Do some minor cleanup of the rules file.
  * Make wrapper scripts work if run with .debathena suffix.
  * Update the manpages to reflect the demise of
    /etc/debathena-printing.conf.
  * Update lp(1) to use the correct argument for specifying a printer.
  * Restore classic behavior of zephyring on job completion by default.
  * Don't ship symlinks for files we're no longer diverting.
  * Recommend apparmor-config for lpr and lpr.debathena whitelisting.
  * Bump Debian standards version.

debathena-printing-config (1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow the IPP URL's path component to start with /classes/ in
    addition to /printers/, since duplex queues are implemented as
    classes, so that we deal with Kerberized duplex queues correctly
    (see [help.mit.edu #1163697]).

debathena-printing-config (1.18.2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Geoffrey Thomas ]
  * Don't treat any Hesiod IOErrors as fatal.

  [ Jonathan Reed ]
  * Add lpropt_transform and zephyr_transform for cups invocation of lpr,
    so that LPROPT is respected when the command-line arguments are
    subsystem-agnostic (Trac #509)

 -- Jonathan Reed <jdreed@mit.edu>  Fri, 12 Mar 2010 10:17:52 -0500

debathena-printing-config (1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Evan Broder ]
  * Include add-athena-printer script for configuring Athena print queues
    not available via BrowsePoll.

  [ Geoffrey Thomas ]
  * Apparently -z on Athena-patched LPRng was a nop because Zephyr was
    the default, and there was a -N to disable zephyr. Adjust our
    wrapper to match.

debathena-printing-config (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * When doing operations against CUPS printers, act against the
    realserver because load balancing otherwise gets in your way.
  * Remove /etc/debathena-printing.conf and revert 1.4 and much of 1.7.
    Use the printing subsystem that the print queue lives on; attempt to
    convert LPRng options to CUPS ones for CUPS printers, but not vice
    versa.
  * Rephrase man pages to stop talking about Athena 10, and mention
    cups-lp(1)'s documentation of the -o options to lpr.
  * Fix a bug relating to lp using -d for its destination, not -P.
  * Stop wrapping lpc, since it's only useful with LPRng, and cancel,
    since it's not useful with LPRng (it's treated exactly the same
    as LPRng's lprm).

 -- Geoffrey Thomas <geofft@mit.edu>  Tue, 01 Dec 2009 02:11:08 -0500

debathena-printing-config (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

debathena-printing-config (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Take advantage of the new clusterinfo update.d hook to set a default
    CUPS printer when clusterinfo gets updated. (Trac: #411)

 -- Evan Broder <broder@mit.edu>  Tue, 10 Nov 2009 14:44:50 -0500

debathena-printing-config (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

debathena-printing-config (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable the file, cups, and lpr printing backends (instead of just file

 -- Evan Broder <broder@mit.edu>  Tue, 15 Sep 2009 14:46:59 -0400

debathena-printing-config (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Insert LPROPT at the beginning of the options, rather than after the
    first option (which may accidentally split an option and its arguments).
  * Fix some issues with transformations to the 'args' variable sticking
    around for a larger scope than they were intended to. This prevents
    LPROPT from being inserted if we fall back from lprng to cups.

 -- Geoffrey Thomas <geofft@mit.edu>  Fri, 11 Sep 2009 15:36:31 -0400

debathena-printing-config (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

debathena-printing-config (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * If you're using system-config-printer with notification popups,
    notify that the job was sent to the printer rather than that it was
    successfully printed, since that's not necessarily true for remote
    printers (Trac: #281).
