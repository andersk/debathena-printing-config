    This function makes a best effort to figure out which server and

    If a specified queue appears to be an Athena print queue, we use
    Hesiod to determine the print server. If the print server in
    Hesiod accepts connections on port 631, we conclude that jobs
    should be sent to that server over CUPS. Otherwise, we assume
    LPRng.

    A queue is assumed to be an Athena print queue if it's not
    configured in the default CUPS server. It's also assumed to be an
    Athena print queue if the default CUPS server simply bounces jobs
    to any of the Athena print servers.

    If a queue is not an Athena print queue, then we always use the
    default CUPS server.

    Note that users might configure a local print queue pointing to an
    Athena print queue with a different name from the Athena print
    queue (i.e. have a w20 queue that bounces jobs to the ajax Athena
    queue). In that scenario, we still want to send the job directly
    to the Athena print server, but we also need to translate the
    name. Therefore, find_queue includes the translated queue name in
